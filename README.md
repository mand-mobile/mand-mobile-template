# mand-mobile-template

> A full-featured Webpack setup with Mand Mobile and also with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, css extraction.

## Usage

This is a [Mand Mobile](https://github.com/didi/mand-mobile) project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init mand-mobile/mand-mobile-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.
